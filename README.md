## Sentinel 3-Finland/Russia-Cloud Classification
Using k-means classification to analyse SENTINEL-3 satellite data for cloud classification across Finland.

## A description of the problem to be tackled
 Optical satellite imagery is an indispensable tool for global Earth observation, however the presence of clouds and their associated shadows can create atmospheric obstructions. This obscuring of significant portions of the Earth's surface can lead to data gaps needed for consistent land cover and atmosphere montioring. Therefore, to effectively make use of high resolution optical data obtained by Sentinel 3, it is crucial to develop accurate automated methods for compensating for these interferences. 

Traditional cloud detection often relies on complex physical models such as Fmask or extensive labeled training datasets, which can be time consuming. To address these limtations, this project utilises k-means clsutering, an unsupervised classification method, to classify and mask thick clouds, thin clouds, and cloud shadows within Sentinel-3 OLCI radiance imagery. Unsupervised methods are particularly valuable in remote sensing as they can derive patterns directly from the data without prior labeling, offering a flexible solution for automated processing and a flexible solution for diverse environmental conditions. (Zhang, Y., & Wu, L. (2012)

To provide a an assessment of the k means clustering algorithms performance in distinguishing distinct environmental features, the K-Means derived algorithm of clouds is compared against a reference mask generated using the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), a widely recognized spectral index for water detection. Xu, H. (2006) This comparison offers a quantitative insight into the clustering's ability to accurately differentiate between water and other land cover types, complementing its primary goal of cloud and shadow masking.

## A diagram of the K-means clustering algorithm and its implementation

K-Means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that organizes a dataset into a pre-defined number of k distinct groups. In this project, K=4. The fundamental principle involves strategically placing k centroids (central points) and then assigning each data point to the closest nearby centroid. This process ensures that points within the same cluster are as tightly grouped together as possible. It is useful when  exploring data with unknown categories since it doesn't require prior labeling of different classes. As such, it is a powerful tool for initial data exploration and uncovering natural groupings. This makes it suitable for this project because clouds are a great example of natural groupings. (Unsupervised Learning â€” GEOL0069 Guide Book, n.d.) 

## K means clustering can be broken down into the following steps: ##
1. Choosing K: Choose the number of k clusters you want.
2. Centroid Initialization: The initial placement of these k centroids can influence the final clustering outcome.
3. Assignment: Every data point in the dataset is assigned to the nearest centroid. This "nearest" is determined by calculating the squared Euclidean distance between the assigned data point and each centroid.
4. Update: After all points are assigned, the centroids are recalculated. Each centroid moves to the average position (the mean) of all the data points currently assigned to its cluster.
5. Iterate: The assignment and update steps are repeated in a loop. This iterative process continues until the centroids no longer shift significantly, indicating that the clusters have stabilized and the algorithm has converged on a solution.


## Data Overview

As illustrated in the figure above, the Sentinel 3 data encompasses Finland as well as some parts of Russia. The polygon used for data selection can also be seen.

## Data Preparation
## Mount Google Drive
```
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```
## Define the base directory for the Sentinel-3 data
```
nc_dir = '/content/drive/MyDrive/FINLAND CLOUD DATA/dataset'
```
### Convert nc datasets to numpy .npy file and stack bands

The script reads .nc files, processes them using netCDP4 and basemap packages, saves each one as an image, and then saves all the processed arrays as a single .npy file.

## Optional (split data in chunks for manual IRIS classification of clouds) 
In this notebook we will be using the k means classification method. Alternatively, you can split the data into 5 chunks at this stage and create a mask in IRIS. Here is the code to split the data into chunks and then visualise the results:
```

    if not os.path.exists(save_dir):
        os.makedirs(save_dir)

    chunks = np.array_split(data, num_splits, axis=0)

    for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
        save_path = os.path.join(save_dir, f"{prefix}_{i+1}.npy")
        np.save(save_path, chunk)
        print(f"Saved chunk {i+1} to {save_path}")

# Load data using the full path
# Assuming nc_dir is defined from the previous cell
radiance_npy_path = os.path.join(nc_dir, 'radiance.npy')
data = np.load(radiance_npy_path)

# Call split_npy

data = np.load('radiance.npy')

print(f"Data shape: {data.shape}")

# split data into 5 chunks
chunks = np.array_split(data, 5, axis=0)

for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
    print(f'Chunk {i+1} shape: {chunk.shape}')
    plt.imshow(chunk[:, :, 0], cmap='gray')  #

### Project Conclusion

The outcome of the Confusion Matrix was 51.92% which is low. This essentially means that the two different masks (NDWI water and k-mean cluster cloud) are doing a good job at distinguishing these two distinct features. A high agreement would mean that k means was misindeitfying water as cloud or vice versa, making the resulting image unuseful. This highlights that the respective methods, NDWI and k means clustering, are able to identify their respective features with reasonable accuracy. Therefore, the accuracy for each individual mask would be better assessed by comparing each to separate ground truth data rather than each other. 


## Assessment of Environmental Cost of Research Project
##Satellite Operations: Sentinel 3 OLCI
This is the most expensive aspect of this project. This is due to the required electronics, metals as well as the energy intesive nature of building such a complex satellite. Sending the Sentinel 3- OLCI into orbit requires a large amount of fuel and releases a large amount of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse affect. However, this is compensated by the fact that Sentinel-3 is designed for a 7 year operational lifetime with 120 kg of hydrazine propellant allowing up to 12 years of continuous operations. This upfront cost of buildning the satellite is shared amongst its users. (European Space Agency) 

To process satellite data, large amounts of energy is used for cooling systems and electricity to power data centres.  Processing Sentinel 3 Data requires huge data centres such as (EUMETSAT, ESA, Copernicus) which expend loads of energy on cooling systems. (Net Zero Insights. (2025, April 29)) (Olson, E., Grau, A., & Tipton, T. (2024, July 19))

## Computational Power (Machine Learning - K-Means)

Running the K-means learning algorithm on large datasets such as stacked_olci_data, increases electricity usage due to requiring computational power from the computer's CPU. The clustering process can be equally computationally intensive for large images and clusters but for this project k=4, which is a moderate amount of centroids. This reduces the complexity of the computations, reducing energy consumption. (Hess, J. C. (2024, June 20))

## AI 

The use of AI in an assistive role contributes to electricty and water usage. Large amounts of water and electricity is used to power data centres and water is used to cool the servers. (Wang, Q., Li, Y. & Li, R. 2024)

To summarise, this research project contributed to energy consumption and gas emissions by tilising satellite data and computational analysis. This can be mitigated by optimizing code to reduce computation time, only using AI when necessary and opting to choose data centres that use more renewable energy sources.
